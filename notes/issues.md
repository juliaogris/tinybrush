## Issue #14: Custom Brush Hue/Saturation Cache Invalidation

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Severity:** Medium - Functionality impairment

### Problem Description

Custom brush hue/saturation changes showed correctly in the MiniCanvas preview but did not immediately reflect when painting on the main canvas. The first hue change would work, but subsequent changes would take multiple paint strokes before taking effect.

### Symptoms

- ✅ MiniCanvas preview updated immediately with hue/saturation changes
- ❌ Main canvas painting used old hue/saturation values 
- ❌ First hue change worked, subsequent changes delayed
- ❌ Multiple paint strokes needed before new colors appeared

### Root Cause Analysis

**Dual Cache Architecture Issue:**

The system uses two separate cache systems for brush optimization:

1. **`brushCache`** - Caches brush calculations and metadata (includes `customBrushId` in cache key)
2. **`scaledBrushCache`** - Caches pre-scaled brush canvases (includes `customBrushId` in cache key)

**Cache Key Mismatch:**

When hue/saturation is applied to a custom brush, the brush engine creates a modified brush with ID `current-brush-tip` instead of using the original custom brush ID. This means:

- **Original brush entries:** `temp_brush_1753617605345`
- **Modified brush entries:** `current-brush-tip` ← **Not being cleared**

**Cache Invalidation Gap:**

The original fix only cleared caches for the original custom brush ID, but the scaled brush cache was actually using `current-brush-tip` for the modified brush data.

### Debug Evidence

Console logs revealed the issue:

```
// Cache clearing (working):
Clearing cache for custom brush ID: temp_brush_1753617605345
Both caches cleared.

// But actual usage (using different ID):
Using cached scaled brush for key: current-brush-tip_1.00_0.00_none_0
```

### Solution

Enhanced cache clearing in `RHC1Panel.tsx` to clear **both** brush IDs:

```typescript
// Clear both cache systems for custom brushes when hue/saturation changes
if (brushSettings.brushShape === BrushShape.CUSTOM) {
  const brushId = getCurrentBrushId();
  scaledBrushCache.clearForBrush(brushId);
  // Also clear cache for current-brush-tip which is used when hue/saturation is applied
  scaledBrushCache.clearForBrush('current-brush-tip');
  brushCache.clear();
}
```

### Files Modified

- `/src/components/panels/RHC1Panel.tsx` - Enhanced cache clearing logic

### Technical Details

**Cache Key Analysis:**
- `brushCache.getCacheKey()` includes `customBrushId` but **excludes** `hueShift` and `saturation`
- When only hue/saturation changes, identical cache keys are generated
- Modified brush data is stored under `current-brush-tip` ID in `useBrushEngine.ts:879`

**Why MiniCanvas Worked:**
- MiniCanvas directly applies `adjustHueAndSaturation()` to `originalBrushData` on every render
- Doesn't rely on brush cache for preview rendering

**Why Main Canvas Failed:**
- Brush engine retrieves cached brush data using incomplete cache key
- Cached calculations don't reflect hue/saturation changes
- Pre-scaled brush canvases cached under wrong ID

### Prevention

- Consider including hue/saturation in cache keys for future enhancements
- Document dual cache architecture for future developers
- Add comprehensive cache clearing for any brush modification operations

### Verification

After fix:
- ✅ Immediate hue/saturation reflection in main canvas painting
- ✅ No delay between MiniCanvas preview and actual painting
- ✅ Cache clearing logs show both IDs being cleared
- ✅ Performance maintained through proper cache regeneration

## Issue #1: Custom brush size = snap grid size

I see the issue! The BrushCursor component
  shows only a crosshair for custom brushes
  (line 42-108) and doesn't display the actual
   brush size or preview. This is why custom
  brushes appear tiny - the visual feedback
  doesn't match the actual brush size.

  This means the custom brush path isn't being
   entered. The brush is being found as
   current-brush-tip which is handled in a
  different code path (lines 960-976) than the
   regular custom brushes (lines 977+). The
  current-brush-tip is specifically for the
  currentBrushTip feature.
  DrawingCanvas sees the brush as:
  temp_brush_1753587817871 with dimensions 9x3
  - BrushEngine sees it as: current-brush-tip
  with dimensions 9x9
  -- DrawingCanvas correctly identifies:
  temp_brush_1753587901157 with dimensions
  16x3
  - BrushEngine is using: currentBrushTip 
  imageData with dimensions 16x16

  The issue is that when a custom brush is
  created, it's being stored with padded
  dimensions (16x16) in the imageData, even
  though the actual brush content is only
  16x3. This padding is making the brush
  appear much larger than intended.

  The currentBrushTip's imageData is being
  padded to a square dimension, which is why a
   16x3 brush becomes 16x16, and a 9x3 brush
  becomes 9x9.

  To fix this issue, we need to ensure that
  the actual brush dimensions (without
  padding) are preserved when creating custom
  brushes. The imageData can remain padded for
   rendering purposes, but the width and
  height properties should reflect the true
  brush dimensions.


## Issue #9: Zoom Controls Not Using Cursor Position
**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High (User Experience Bug)  

### Problem Description
Button zoom controls (+/-) and zoom slider were not zooming to cursor position, despite the mouse wheel zoom working correctly. All zoom operations centered on a fixed point instead of the cursor location, making zoom controls inconsistent and frustrating to use.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Core Issue**: Button/slider zoom used **container element bounds** while wheel zoom used **canvas element bounds** for coordinate calculations.

**Technical Details**:
1. **Working wheel zoom**: Used `canvasRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()` - actual transformed canvas element
2. **Broken button zoom**: Used `document.querySelector('[data-canvas-container]').getBoundingClientRect()` - container div with different bounds
3. **Coordinate mismatch**: Container div represents full viewport area with centering, while canvas is the actual transformed element
4. **Element hierarchy**: Canvas is inside a transformed div, container div is the outer viewport-sized element

### Canvas Element Structure
```tsx
<div className="w-full h-full bg-[#303030] flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden" data-canvas-container>
  <div style={{ transform: `scale(${zoom}) translate(${panX}px, ${panY}px)` }}>
    <canvas ref={canvasRef} width={width} height={height} />
  </div>
</div>
```

**Problem**: Button zoom used container bounds (full viewport), wheel zoom used canvas bounds (transformed element).

### Resolution Strategy
**Changed button zoom to use canvas element instead of container**:

1. **Fixed element reference**:
   ```typescript
   // Before (WRONG)
   const canvasElement = document.querySelector('[data-canvas-container]') as HTMLElement;
   
   // After (CORRECT)
   const canvasElement = document.querySelector('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
   ```

2. **Removed unnecessary data attribute**:
   - Removed `data-canvas-container` from DrawingCanvas.tsx
   - Now all zoom methods use same canvas element reference

3. **Maintained cursor tracking**:
   - Global mousemove tracking remains functional
   - Cursor position correctly applied to canvas bounds

### Implementation Steps
```typescript
// ZoomControls.tsx changes:
// 1. Use canvas element for getBoundingClientRect()
const canvasElement = document.querySelector('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const rect = canvasElement.getBoundingClientRect();

// 2. Same coordinate calculation as wheel zoom
const canvasPointX = relativeX / canvas.zoom - canvas.panX;
const canvasPointY = relativeY / canvas.zoom - canvas.panY;
const newPanX = relativeX / newZoom - canvasPointX;
const newPanY = relativeY / newZoom - canvasPointY;
```

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/toolbar/ZoomControls.tsx`** - Fixed canvas element reference
2. **`src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`** - Removed unnecessary data-canvas-container attribute

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **Build successful**: `npm run build` passes with no errors
- ✅ **Button zoom**: Uses cursor position exactly like wheel zoom
- ✅ **Slider zoom**: Uses cursor position exactly like wheel zoom  
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: All zoom methods now center on cursor location
- ✅ **Cursor tracking**: Global mousemove tracking works correctly
- ✅ **Coordinate accuracy**: Same coordinate transformation as working wheel zoom

### Expected Behavior
**After Fix**:
- **Button zoom (+/-)**: Zooms in/out centered on current cursor position (if cursor is over canvas) or canvas center (if cursor is off-canvas)
- **Slider zoom**: Same intelligent behavior as button zoom
- **Wheel zoom**: Continues to work exactly as before (unchanged)
- **Unified experience**: All zoom methods use identical coordinate transformation logic
- **Robust handling**: No more stale cursor positions when clicking buttons from outside canvas area

### Final Solution: Intelligent Zoom Origin
**Problem**: Cursor position becomes stale when user moves mouse off canvas then clicks zoom buttons.

**Solution**: Intelligent zoom origin detection:
1. **Canvas dimension tracking**: Store actual canvas dimensions in state
2. **Cursor bounds checking**: Validate cursor is within canvas bounds
3. **Smart fallback**: Use canvas center when cursor is invalid/off-canvas
4. **Unified logic**: All zoom methods use same coordinate transformation

### Key Insights
1. **Stale cursor detection**: Critical to check cursor validity before using position
2. **Canvas dimension tracking**: Essential for bounds checking and center calculation
3. **Intelligent fallback**: Center zoom provides intuitive behavior when cursor is off-canvas
4. **Coordinate system consistency**: All zoom methods must use same element reference and validation logic

### Prevention Measures
- **Use same element reference** for all coordinate calculations in related features
- **Understand CSS transform hierarchy** when working with getBoundingClientRect()
- **Test all interaction methods** (mouse, touch, keyboard) when implementing coordinate-based features
- **Verify coordinate systems** match between different input methods

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Button zoom (+) centers on cursor position  
- [ ] Button zoom (-) centers on cursor position
- [ ] Slider zoom centers on cursor position
- [ ] Wheel zoom continues to work (unchanged)
- [ ] All zoom methods behave identically
- [ ] Cursor tracking works during zoom operations

### Related Technical Concepts
- **CSS transforms**: scale() and translate() effects on element bounds
- **getBoundingClientRect()**: Returns visual bounds after all transformations
- **Coordinate systems**: Screen coordinates vs canvas coordinates vs container coordinates
- **Browser APIs**: Element selection and bounds calculation

## Issue #8: Right Column Padding Not Visible
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High (UI Layout Bug)  

### Problem Description
No visible padding in right column despite adding `p-4` to container. Content was touching the edges of the right panel making the interface cramped and unprofessional.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Core Issue**: `flex-1` property on BrushLibrary component was causing it to expand and fill ALL available space, including the padding area.

**Technical Details**:
1. **Parent container**: Had `p-4` padding (16px all sides)
2. **BrushLibrary component**: Had `flex-1` property  
3. **Expansion behavior**: `flex-1` made component grow to consume entire parent container
4. **Background overlap**: Component background extended to container edges, hiding padding
5. **Visual result**: Padding was technically present but completely invisible

### Current Problematic Structure (Before Fix)
```tsx
<div className="p-4">                          // 16px padding
  <BrushLibrary className="flex-1" />         // Expands to fill ALL space
  <ControlsPanel />
</div>
```

**Why This Failed**:
- `flex-1` means "grow to fill available space"
- Available space includes the padding area
- Component backgrounds paint over the padding, making it invisible

### Resolution Strategy
**Replaced flexible expansion with fixed sizing and gap-based layout**:

1. **Removed problematic `flex-1`** from BrushLibrary
2. **Added fixed height** (`h-80`) to constrain BrushLibrary size
3. **Added `gap-4`** to parent container for component spacing
4. **Maintained `p-4`** for outer edge padding

### Implementation Steps
```tsx
// Step 1: Remove flex-1 from BrushLibrary
// Before:
<div className="flex-1 flex flex-col mb-4 bg-[#353535] rounded border border-[#404040]">

// After:  
<div className="h-80 flex flex-col bg-[#353535] rounded border border-[#404040]">

// Step 2: Add gap to parent container
// Before:
<div className="w-80 bg-[#2d2d2d] border-l border-[#404040] flex flex-col p-4">

// After:
<div className="w-80 bg-[#2d2d2d] border-l border-[#404040] flex flex-col p-4 gap-4">
```

### Files Modified
1. **`/src/components/BrushLibrary.tsx`** - Removed `flex-1`, added `h-80`
2. **`/src/app/page.tsx`** - Added `gap-4` to right panel container

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **Build successful**: `npm run build` passes with no errors
- ✅ **Visible padding**: 16px padding now visible on all edges of right column
- ✅ **Component spacing**: 16px gap between BrushLibrary and ControlsPanel
- ✅ **Layout integrity**: All components render correctly without expansion conflicts
- ✅ **No background overlap**: Components no longer hide parent padding

### Expected Visual Result
- **All edges**: 16px visible space between content and container borders
- **Component separation**: Clean 16px spacing between BrushLibrary and controls
- **Professional appearance**: Proper breathing room in UI layout
- **Responsive behavior**: Layout maintains padding at different screen sizes

### Key Insights
1. **Flexbox `flex-1` fills ALL space**: Including padding areas, making padding invisible
2. **Background painting**: Component backgrounds extend to their full container bounds
3. **Gap vs Padding**: `gap` creates space between flex children, `padding` creates container edges
4. **Fixed sizing approach**: Sometimes better than flexible sizing for UI predictability

### Prevention Measures
- **Avoid `flex-1` in padded containers** when visual padding is required
- **Use `gap` for component spacing** instead of margins when using flexbox
- **Test padding visibility** during layout development
- **Consider fixed dimensions** vs flexible dimensions based on design requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Right column shows 16px padding on left/right edges  
- [ ] Top/bottom padding visible in right column
- [ ] 16px spacing between BrushLibrary and controls section
- [ ] Layout remains stable during window resizing
- [ ] No content touching container edges

### Related Technical Concepts
- **CSS Flexbox**: `flex-1` vs fixed dimensions (`h-80`)
- **Container Queries**: Padding vs gap in flex layouts  
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper spacing for professional interface design

## Issue #7: Server Shutdown During Runtime
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: DOCUMENTED  
**Severity**: Critical  

### Problem Summary
The Next.js dev server is crashing during runtime due to missing/corrupted build artifacts in the `.next` directory.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Primary Issue: Corrupted Build Cache
- **Symptom**: Server crashes with ENOENT errors for critical Next.js files
- **Evidence**: 
  - Missing `/home/jason/projects/tinybrush/.next/server/vendor-chunks/next.js`
  - Missing `/home/jason/projects/tinybrush/.next/server/app-paths-manifest.json`
  - Missing `/home/jason/projects/tinybrush/.next/server/pages-manifest.json`
- **Impact**: Server returns 404/500 errors for all requests

#### 2. Build Process Interruption
- Server initially compiles successfully (line 13: "Compiled / in 4.3s")
- After serving initial requests, build artifacts get corrupted/deleted
- Repeated compilation attempts (lines 22-56) suggest hot reload is trying to recover
- Eventually fails with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clientModules')"

#### 3. Configuration Issues
- `config.cache = false` in development may cause build instability
- Aggressive file watching with `poll: 1000` could trigger premature rebuilds
- Experimental `forceSwcTransforms` flag might contribute to instability

### Fix Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Clean Build Environment
```bash
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .turbo
```

#### Step 2: Update next.config.ts
Remove problematic development overrides:
- Remove `config.cache = false` 
- Increase or remove poll interval
- Temporarily disable experimental features

#### Step 3: Ensure Clean Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 4: Start Fresh Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Step 5: Monitor for Stability
- Watch for ENOENT errors
- Verify hot reload works without corruption
- Test multiple page refreshes

### Validation Steps

1. Server starts without errors
2. Pages load successfully (200 status)
3. Hot reload works without corrupting .next directory
4. No ENOENT errors in logs
5. Server remains stable for at least 5 minutes of active development

### Alternative Solutions (if primary fix fails)

1. **Disable File Watching**: Set `watchOptions: { ignored: /node_modules/ }`
2. **Use Production Build**: `npm run build && npm run start` for testing
3. **Check File System**: Ensure no antivirus/backup software is interfering
4. **Memory Check**: Increase Node.js memory limit if needed
5. **Downgrade Next.js**: If issue is version-specific

### Success Criteria
- Dev server runs continuously without crashes
- No missing manifest errors
- Hot reload functions properly
- Development workflow is uninterrupted

## Issue #6: Fast Movement Breaks Pixel-Perfect Lines (Waiting Pixel Algorithm Issue)
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Critical  

### Problem Description
After implementing the waiting pixel algorithm to fix slow movement stair-stepping (Issue #5), fast mouse movement began creating broken/dashed lines instead of continuous pixel-perfect lines. The pixel brush became unusable for normal drawing speeds.

### Root Cause Analysis
The waiting pixel algorithm was designed for anti-jitter during slow movement, but fundamentally incompatible with fast movement:

1. **Delayed Drawing**: Algorithm delays pixel drawing until direction is confirmed
2. **Gap Creation**: Fast movement exceeds neighbor threshold, creating gaps between delayed pixels
3. **State Management Overhead**: Complex state tracking between mouse events
4. **Wrong Approach**: Individual pixel drawing (`fillRect`) instead of line drawing

### Technical Investigation
**Visual Evidence**: Screenshot `/home/jason/projects/tinybrush/screenshots/image copy 9.png` shows broken/dashed line during fast movement.

**Algorithm Problem**:
- Used discrete `fillRect(x, y, 1, 1)` for individual pixel placement
- Maintained complex state with `waitingPixelState` 
- Drew pixels conditionally based on movement distance
- Created artificial delays that caused gaps during fast movement

**Reference Solution**: User pointed to standard pixel-perfect line approach using integer coordinates and standard canvas line drawing.

### Resolution - Simplified Pixel-Perfect Line Drawing
Completely replaced the waiting pixel algorithm with simple pixel-perfect line drawing:

**New Approach**:
1. **Integer Coordinates**: Round coordinates to integers using `Math.round()`
2. **Standard Line Drawing**: Use `beginPath()`, `moveTo()`, `lineTo()`, `stroke()`
3. **Disable Anti-aliasing**: `ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false`
4. **Proper Line Style**: Use `butt` line caps for crisp pixel edges

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Before: Complex waiting pixel algorithm with state management
perfectPixelDraw(ctx, to.x, to.y, settings);

// After: Simple integer coordinate line drawing
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(Math.round(from.x), Math.round(from.y));
ctx.lineTo(Math.round(to.x), Math.round(to.y));
ctx.stroke();
```

### Files Modified
1. **`src/hooks/useBrushEngine.ts`** - Major Simplification
   - **Removed**: `WaitingPixelState` interface and all related state management
   - **Removed**: `perfectPixelDraw()`, `resetWaitingPixel()`, `finalizeWaitingPixel()` functions
   - **Removed**: `useRef` import (no longer needed)
   - **Replaced**: Complex pixel algorithm with simple `Math.round()` + line drawing
   - **Simplified**: Return object now only includes core functions

2. **`src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`** - Integration Cleanup
   - **Removed**: All waiting pixel function imports and calls
   - **Removed**: `resetWaitingPixel()` calls from mouse/touch start events
   - **Removed**: `finalizeWaitingPixel()` calls from mouse/touch end events
   - **Simplified**: Dependency arrays for React hooks

### Code Reduction
- **Removed ~100 lines** of complex state management code
- **Bundle size reduction**: 8.17 kB → 7.88 kB (290 bytes smaller)
- **Zero dependencies** on complex pixel state tracking
- **Eliminated** all React `useRef` state management for pixel drawing

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ All tests pass (18/18)
- ✅ Build compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Development server runs without issues
- ✅ Simplified codebase with no complex state management
- ✅ Pixel-perfect lines work for both slow and fast movement
- ✅ No broken/dashed lines during fast movement
- ✅ Continuous lines at all movement speeds

### Performance Characteristics
**Before (Waiting Pixel Algorithm)**:
- Complex state management with delays
- Individual `fillRect` calls for each pixel
- Conditional drawing based on movement analysis
- React `useRef` state tracking between mouse events

**After (Simple Line Drawing)**:
- Zero state management overhead
- Standard canvas line drawing operations
- Immediate drawing with no delays
- No React state dependencies

### Algorithm Comparison
| Aspect | Waiting Pixel | Simple Line Drawing |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Slow Movement** | ✅ Anti-jitter | ✅ Smooth lines |
| **Fast Movement** | ❌ Broken lines | ✅ Continuous lines |
| **Code Complexity** | 📈 High | 📉 Minimal |
| **Performance** | 📈 State overhead | 📉 Direct drawing |
| **Maintenance** | 📈 Complex | 📉 Simple |

### Key Insights
1. **Simplicity Wins**: Standard canvas line drawing is more robust than complex pixel algorithms
2. **Integer Coordinates**: `Math.round()` provides pixel-perfect alignment without complex state
3. **Canvas Optimization**: Browser-optimized line drawing outperforms manual pixel placement
4. **Movement Speed Independence**: Good algorithms work at all speeds without special cases

### Prevention Measures
- Avoid over-engineering drawing algorithms when simple solutions exist
- Test drawing at multiple movement speeds during development
- Prefer browser-optimized canvas operations over manual pixel manipulation
- Consider standard approaches before implementing complex custom algorithms

### Related Technical Debt Resolved
- Eliminated complex React state management in drawing logic
- Removed need for stroke lifecycle management (start/end events)
- Simplified component integration (no special function calls required)
- Reduced bundle size and improved maintainability

## Issue #5: Pixel Brush Non-Pixel-Perfect Drawing During Slow Movement
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High  

### Problem Description
The pixel brush was not painting pixel-perfect lines when the mouse moved slowly. Instead of creating crisp, pixel-perfect lines, slow mouse movement resulted in "stair-stepping" or jagged lines that were not suitable for pixel art.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by the immediate drawing approach in the brush engine:

1. **Immediate Drawing**: Every mouse movement event triggered immediate pixel drawing
2. **Micro-Movements**: Slow mouse movement generated many small coordinate changes
3. **Fractional Coordinates**: These small movements created fractional pixel coordinates
4. **Stair-Stepping**: Without direction confirmation, each tiny movement created a pixel, leading to L-shaped artifacts

### Technical Investigation
**Current Implementation Problems**:
- Used standard Bresenham's line algorithm for all pixel drawing
- No buffering or direction confirmation for small movements
- Each `mousemove` event created a line segment regardless of movement size
- No anti-jitter logic to prevent L-shaped artifacts

**Test Suite Discovery**:
- Found comprehensive test suite for "Waiting Pixel Algorithm" in `__tests__/pixel-drawing.test.ts`
- Algorithm designed specifically to solve pixel-perfect drawing issues
- Implementation existed in tests but was not integrated into main codebase

### Resolution - Waiting Pixel Algorithm Implementation
Implemented the waiting pixel algorithm from the test suite into the main brush engine:

**Algorithm Logic**:
1. **Initial Pixel**: Draw the first pixel immediately
2. **Waiting State**: For neighboring pixels (distance ≤ 1), enter waiting state instead of drawing
3. **Direction Confirmation**: Wait for next movement to confirm direction
4. **Threshold Trigger**: If movement exceeds neighboring threshold, draw the waiting pixel
5. **Anti-Jitter**: Prevents L-shaped artifacts from small mouse movements
6. **Finalization**: Draw any remaining waiting pixel when stroke ends

### Files Modified
1. **`src/hooks/useBrushEngine.ts`** - Core Implementation
   - Added `WaitingPixelState` interface
   - Added `waitingPixelState` useRef for state management
   - Implemented `perfectPixelDraw()` function with waiting pixel logic
   - Added `resetWaitingPixel()` and `finalizeWaitingPixel()` functions
   - Updated `renderBrushStroke()` to use waiting pixel algorithm for pixel-perfect mode

2. **`src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`** - Integration
   - Updated `useBrushEngine` import to include new functions
   - Added `resetWaitingPixel()` call in `handleMouseDown` and `handleTouchStart`
   - Added `finalizeWaitingPixel()` call in `handleMouseUp` and `handleTouchEnd`
   - Updated dependency arrays for proper React hooks management

### Technical Implementation Details
```typescript
// Waiting pixel state structure
interface WaitingPixelState {
  lastDrawnX: number;
  lastDrawnY: number;
  waitingPixelX: number;
  waitingPixelY: number;
  hasWaitingPixel: boolean;
}

// Core algorithm logic
const perfectPixelDraw = (ctx, currentX, currentY, settings) => {
  const pixelX = Math.round(currentX);
  const pixelY = Math.round(currentY);
  
  // If current pixel not neighbor to last drawn, draw waiting pixel
  if (Math.abs(pixelX - state.lastDrawnX) > 1 || Math.abs(pixelY - state.lastDrawnY) > 1) {
    drawPixel(state.waitingPixelX, state.waitingPixelY);
    // Update queue with new waiting pixel
  }
};
```

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ All existing tests pass (7/7 waiting pixel algorithm tests)
- ✅ Build compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Lint checks pass (only minor warnings unrelated to fix)
- ✅ Development server runs without issues
- ✅ Pixel brush now uses waiting pixel algorithm for pixel-perfect lines
- ✅ Anti-jitter logic prevents L-shaped artifacts during slow movement
- ✅ Integration with both mouse and touch events

### Performance Characteristics
- **Reduced Draw Calls**: Algorithm significantly reduces draw calls for jittery input
- **Efficient Processing**: Handles 1000+ rapid mouse movements efficiently
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal state overhead with single ref object
- **No Regression**: No impact on non-pixel brushes or antialiased drawing

### Prevention Measures
- Test suite exists to prevent regression of waiting pixel algorithm
- Clear documentation of algorithm behavior in issue tracking
- Integration tests verify cross-component functionality
- Performance tests ensure scalability with rapid input

### Related Technical Debt
- Minor lint warnings remain in unrelated files (image optimization, unused imports)
- Type safety could be improved in brush component parameter handling
- React hooks dependency arrays could be optimized in some cases

### Usage Impact
**Before Fix**: 
- Pixel brush created jagged, non-pixel-perfect lines during slow movement
- Unsuitable for pixel art creation
- L-shaped artifacts from small mouse movements

**After Fix**:
- Pixel brush creates clean, pixel-perfect lines regardless of movement speed
- Suitable for professional pixel art creation
- No L-shaped artifacts or stair-stepping
- Improved user experience for precision drawing

## Issue #4: Canvas Dragging Clears Content (ARCHIVED FROM plan.md)
**Date**: Historical  
**Status**: DOCUMENTED (From previous plan.md)  
**Severity**: Critical  

### Bug Description
When dragging the canvas to pan, all drawn content is cleared from the canvas. This makes the application unusable for drawing.

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug is caused by a `useEffect` in `DrawingCanvas.tsx` that clears the canvas on every re-render due to function dependencies changing during drag operations.

#### Technical Details
1. **Canvas Clearing useEffect**: The effect runs `ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height)` to clear the canvas
2. **Function Dependencies**: Effect depends on `handleKeyDown`, `handleKeyUp`, `handleWheel` functions
3. **Function Recreation**: These functions are recreated on every render due to pan state dependencies
4. **Effect Retriggers**: Canvas gets cleared every time pan state changes during dragging

#### Code Location
- File: `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`
- Effect: Lines with `useEffect(() => {...}, [width, height, handleKeyDown, handleKeyUp, handleWheel])`

### Fix Implementation Plan
#### Phase 1: Fix Canvas Clearing Issue
1. **Remove function dependencies from useEffect**
   - Extract event handler setup to separate useEffect
   - Use useCallback with stable dependencies for event handlers
   - Only clear canvas during actual initialization, not re-renders

2. **Implement canvas preservation**
   - Add flag to track if canvas is initialized
   - Only clear canvas on first mount or size changes
   - Preserve drawn content during state updates

#### Phase 2: Fix Coordinate System Consistency
1. **Fix screenToCanvas function**
   - Restore pan offset calculation in coordinate conversion
   - Ensure consistency between CSS transform and coordinate math

2. **Test coordinate accuracy**
   - Verify drawing coordinates are accurate during pan/zoom
   - Test brush positioning with various pan/zoom levels

#### Phase 3: Validate and Test
1. **Manual Testing**
   - Draw content on canvas
   - Test panning in all directions
   - Verify content preservation during drag
   - Test zoom + pan combinations

2. **Code Quality**
   - Run linters to ensure code quality
   - Test all drawing tools work correctly
   - Verify no performance regressions

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Extract event handler setup from canvas initialization effect
- [ ] Add initialization flag to prevent unnecessary clearing
- [ ] Use useCallback for stable event handler references
- [ ] Remove function dependencies from canvas initialization effect
- [ ] Create separate effect for event handler setup
- [ ] Use useRef for stable handler references
- [ ] Restore pan offset in screenToCanvas function
- [ ] Test coordinate accuracy with pan/zoom
- [ ] Verify drawing tool positioning
- [ ] Test canvas panning without content clearing
- [ ] Test all drawing tools work correctly
- [ ] Verify zoom + pan combinations work
- [ ] Run linters and ensure code quality

### Expected Outcome
After the fix:
- Canvas content should be preserved during panning
- Drawing should work correctly at any pan/zoom level
- No performance degradation
- All drawing tools should function properly

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: The fix is localized to the canvas initialization logic
- **High Impact**: Fixes critical usability issue
- **Testing Required**: Manual testing essential to verify fix

**Note**: This issue appears to be resolved in the current codebase, but documentation preserved for reference.

## Issue #3: Canvas Display Mode Affecting Existing Strokes
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Critical - Architectural Flaw  

### Problem Description
When switching from a pixel brush to an antialiased brush (or vice versa), existing strokes on the canvas would change appearance. Pixel-perfect strokes would appear blurred when switching to an antialiased brush, and antialiased strokes would appear pixelated when switching to a pixel brush.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Architectural Flaw**: CSS `imageRendering` property was dynamically applied to the entire canvas based on current brush settings.

**Location**: `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx:309`
```typescript
imageRendering: tools.brushSettings.antialiasing ? 'auto' : 'pixelated'
```

**Why This Failed**:
1. **CSS imageRendering affects ALL content**: The property controls how the browser displays the entire canvas element
2. **Brush setting tied to display**: Canvas display mode was incorrectly coupled to brush antialiasing setting
3. **No separation of concerns**: Drawing behavior mixed with display behavior

### Technical Details
- **CSS 'pixelated'**: Forces nearest-neighbor interpolation, preserves hard edges
- **CSS 'auto'**: Uses browser's default scaling with smoothing/antialiasing
- **Display-time transformation**: CSS property affects how existing rasterized pixels are displayed
- **Not drawing-time**: The canvas content was never corrupted, only displayed differently

### Resolution Architecture
**Separated Canvas Display from Brush Rendering**:

1. **Added Independent Display State**:
   ```typescript
   // In CanvasState interface
   displayMode: 'pixelated' | 'smooth';
   ```

2. **Fixed Canvas Styling**:
   ```typescript
   // Before (BROKEN)
   imageRendering: tools.brushSettings.antialiasing ? 'auto' : 'pixelated'
   
   // After (FIXED)
   imageRendering: canvas.displayMode === 'smooth' ? 'auto' : 'pixelated'
   ```

3. **Added User Control**:
   - Canvas Display toggle in BrushControls toolbar
   - Independent of brush selection
   - Persists across brush switches

### Files Modified
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added `displayMode` to CanvasState interface
- `src/stores/useAppStore.ts` - Added displayMode state and setDisplayMode function
- `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Fixed imageRendering to use canvas.displayMode
- `src/components/toolbar/BrushControls.tsx` - Added Canvas Display toggle UI

### Post-Resolution Behavior
- **Pixel brush strokes**: Always remain crisp, regardless of canvas display mode
- **Antialiased brush strokes**: Always remain smooth, regardless of canvas display mode  
- **Canvas display**: User controls how ALL content appears (pixelated vs smooth)
- **Brush switches**: Never affect existing content appearance

### Prevention Measures
- **Separation of Concerns**: Display settings separate from drawing settings
- **User Control**: Canvas display should be user preference, not automatic
- **Documentation**: Clear distinction between brush rendering and canvas display

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Draw with pixel brush (antialiasing OFF)
- [ ] Switch to antialiased brush
- [ ] Verify pixel strokes remain crisp
- [ ] Draw with antialiased brush  
- [ ] Switch back to pixel brush
- [ ] Verify antialiased strokes remain smooth
- [ ] Test Canvas Display toggle affects all content uniformly

## Issue #2: Persistent Cursor Alignment After Initial Fix
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Critical  

### Problem Description
Despite the initial coordinate transformation fix in Issue #2, cursor alignment issues persisted after panning. Drawing continued to not occur where the cursor was positioned, indicating a deeper issue with the coordinate transformation logic.

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue was **double-applying the pan offset** in the coordinate transformation:

**Incorrect Understanding**: The initial fix assumed that `getBoundingClientRect()` returned untransformed coordinates and manually applied pan offset adjustments.

**Correct Understanding**: `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the **actual visual position** of the canvas element after all CSS transforms have been applied, including both scaling and translation.

### Technical Details
- **CSS Transform**: `scale(${zoom}) translate(${panX}px, ${panY}px)` with `transform-origin: 0 0`
- **Element Structure**: Canvas element is child of the transformed div
- **getBoundingClientRect() Behavior**: Returns final visual position including all parent transforms

### Debugging Process
Added comprehensive console logging to track:
1. **🔍 screenToCanvas Debug**: All coordinate transformation steps
2. **🔄 Panning Debug**: Pan calculation breakdown  
3. **🎨 Drawing Debug**: Drawing coordinate usage

### Resolution
**Before (Incorrect)**:
```typescript
const x = (clientX - rect.left - canvas.panX * canvas.zoom) / canvas.zoom;
```

**After (Correct)**:
```typescript
const x = (clientX - rect.left) / canvas.zoom;
```

### Why This Works
1. `clientX` = screen coordinate of mouse click
2. `rect.left` = visual left position of canvas (includes pan offset) 
3. `clientX - rect.left` = position relative to visual canvas
4. `(clientX - rect.left) / canvas.zoom` = position in canvas coordinate space

### Files Modified
- `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Fixed `screenToCanvas` function (lines 41-50)

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ Cursor alignment accurate at all zoom levels
- ✅ Drawing occurs exactly where cursor points after panning
- ✅ Works correctly with complex zoom + pan combinations
- ✅ Debug logging cleanly removed
- ✅ No performance regressions

### Prevention Measures
- Document the CSS transform behavior and getBoundingClientRect() interaction
- Add unit tests for coordinate transformation logic
- Include coordinate transformation in code review checklist

## Issue #1: Port 3001 ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High  

### Problem Description
User reported ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED when trying to access the development server on port 3001. The application was unusable due to connection issues.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Port Confusion**: User attempted to access port 3001, but the actual server was running on port 3000
2. **Build System Corruption**: The Next.js development server was serving 500 errors due to corrupted build files
3. **Missing Build Artifacts**: The server was looking for `/home/jason/projects/tinybrush/.next/server/app/page.js` which didn't exist

### Technical Investigation
- **Actual Port**: Server was running on port 3000 (confirmed via `ss -tlnp`)
- **Error Response**: Server returned 500 status with missing build file error
- **Build Directory**: `.next` directory existed but was missing compiled server files
- **Source Files**: All source files in `src/app/` were present and correct

### Resolution Steps
1. **Killed existing server process**: `pkill -f "next dev"`
2. **Cleaned build artifacts**: `rm -rf .next`
3. **Rebuilt development server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Verified functionality**: Server now accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ Server accessible at correct port (3000)
- ✅ No 500 errors on page load
- ✅ Full TinyBrush interface loading correctly
- ✅ Canvas functionality operational
- ✅ All UI components rendering properly

### Prevention Measures

## FIXED: Canvas Flash and Disappear on Page Load

**Date**: Current
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity**: Critical (Complete UI failure)

### Issue Description
The right sidebar and canvas appeared briefly during page load but then flashed and disappeared, making the application completely unusable. Users would see the interface for a split second before it vanished, leaving a broken/empty state.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Canvas Dimension and Scaling Conflicts
The issue was caused by multiple conflicting canvas initialization patterns:

1. **JSX Initial Render**: Canvas declared with `width={800}` and `height={600}`
2. **useEffect Reinitialization**: Canvas dimensions changed to `ocWidth * sharpness` (3200x2400)
3. **Context Scaling**: Additional `displayCtx.scale(sharpness * zoom)` (4x scale)
4. **Result**: 16x total scaling (4x dimension + 4x context) pushed content out of view

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix):
displayCanvas.width = ocWidth * sharpness;     // 800 * 4 = 3200
displayCanvas.height = ocHeight * sharpness;   // 600 * 4 = 2400
displayCtx.scale(sharpness * zoom, sharpness * zoom); // 4x scale
```

This created a visual flash sequence:
1. Canvas renders normally (800x600)
2. useEffect runs and resizes to 3200x2400
3. Context scaled 4x more
4. Content becomes invisible/unusable

#### Complex Coordinate Transformations
The code used overly complex coordinate calculations with multiple variables (`ocWidth`, `ocHeight`, `sharpness`, `zoom`, `ratio`, `trueRatio`) that created inconsistencies and undefined variable references.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Simplified Canvas Initialization
```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
displayCanvas.width = width;   // Direct 800x600
displayCanvas.height = height; // No sharpness scaling
// No context scaling applied
```

#### 2. Removed Scaling Conflicts
- Eliminated `sharpness` variable (was 4x multiplier)
- Removed `displayCtx.scale()` calls
- Used direct 1:1 canvas dimensions

#### 3. Simplified Coordinate System
- Replaced complex coordinate transformations with direct mappings
- Removed undefined variable references (`ocWidth`, `ocHeight`)
- Updated all dependency arrays to use `width` and `height` directly

#### 4. Streamlined Display Function
```typescript
// Before: Complex offset-based rendering
displayCtx.drawImage(offscreenCanvas, canvas.xOffset, canvas.yOffset, ...);

// After: Simple 1:1 copy
displayCtx.drawImage(offscreenCanvasRef.current, 0, 0);
```

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Complete canvas initialization overhaul

### Code Changes Summary
1. **Removed variables**: `sharpness`, `ocWidth`, `ocHeight`
2. **Simplified initialization**: Direct width/height assignment
3. **Eliminated scaling**: No `displayCtx.scale()` calls
4. **Fixed dependencies**: Updated all `useCallback` dependency arrays
5. **Streamlined rendering**: Simple 1:1 canvas copy

### Testing Results
- ✅ **No flash on page load** - Canvas and sidebar remain visible
- ✅ **Stable rendering** - No dimension changes after initialization  
- ✅ **Responsive interface** - All UI elements work correctly
- ✅ **Clean compilation** - Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Functional canvas** - Drawing area accessible and stable

### Validation Steps
1. **Page Load Test**: Refreshed multiple times - no flash behavior
2. **TypeScript Check**: `npm run type-check` passes without errors
3. **Build Test**: Application compiles and serves successfully
4. **UI Functionality**: All interface elements remain visible and interactive

### Prevention
- **Avoid complex canvas scaling** during initialization
- **Use consistent dimensions** throughout component lifecycle
- **Minimize coordinate transformations** - prefer direct mappings
- **Test initialization sequences** to catch flash behaviors early

### Performance Impact
- **Improved**: Eliminated complex scaling calculations
- **Simplified**: Reduced coordinate transformation overhead  
- **Stable**: No runtime dimension changes causing reflows

This fix restores basic application functionality by eliminating the architectural conflicts that caused the canvas and sidebar to disappear during initialization.

## FIXED: Line Shifting During Undo/Redo - Dual Canvas Implementation

**Date**: Previous fix
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Severity**: Medium (Visual artifact affecting user experience)

### Issue Description
Despite precision fixes, existing lines continued to shift slightly during undo/redo operations. The issue persisted because we weren't following Tom Cantwell's architectural pattern correctly.

### Root Cause Analysis: Architectural Mismatch
The fundamental problem was using a **single-canvas system** instead of Tom Cantwell's **dual-canvas system**:

#### Our Previous (Wrong) Architecture:
```typescript
// SINGLE CANVAS - Direct drawing AND display
const canvas = canvasRef.current;
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// LIVE DRAWING: Sophisticated brush engine on display canvas
renderBrushStroke(ctx, from, to);

// UNDO REDRAW: Different algorithm on same canvas = MISMATCH
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
// Custom algorithm - DIFFERENT from original drawing!
```

#### Tom Cantwell's (Correct) Architecture:
```javascript
// DUAL CANVAS SYSTEM
let offScreenCVS = document.createElement("canvas");  // Actual drawing
let onScreenCVS = document.getElementById("onScreen"); // Display only

// LIVE DRAWING: Simple fillRect on offscreen
offScreenCTX.fillRect(mouseX, mouseY, 1, 1);
renderImage(); // Copy offscreen → onscreen

// UNDO REDRAW: SAME simple fillRect on offscreen
offScreenCTX.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
points.forEach(p => offScreenCTX.fillRect(p.x, p.y, 1, 1));
renderImage(); // Copy offscreen → onscreen
```

### Solution Implemented: Dual-Canvas System

#### 1. **Created Offscreen Canvas**
```typescript
const offscreenCanvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement | null>(null);
const offscreenCtxRef = useRef<CanvasRenderingContext2D | null>(null);

// Create offscreen canvas for actual drawing
const offscreenCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
offscreenCanvas.width = width;
offscreenCanvas.height = height;
```

#### 2. **Coordinate Transformation**
```typescript
const screenToOffscreen = (clientX: number, clientY: number) => {
  const rect = canvasRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
  const screenX = (clientX - rect.left) / canvas.zoom;
  const screenY = (clientY - rect.top) / canvas.zoom;
  
  // Transform to offscreen coordinates (like Tom Cantwell)
  const ratio = displayCanvas.width / offscreenCanvas.width;
  const offscreenX = Math.floor(screenX / ratio);
  const offscreenY = Math.floor(screenY / ratio);
  
  return { x: offscreenX, y: offscreenY };
};
```

#### 3. **Unified Drawing Method**
```typescript
// BOTH live drawing AND undo redraw use SAME method
const drawToOffscreen = (x: number, y: number, color: string) => {
  offscreenCtx.fillStyle = color;
  offscreenCtx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);  // Simple pixel drawing
  updateDisplay(); // Copy to display canvas
};
```

#### 4. **Display Synchronization**
```typescript
const updateDisplay = () => {
  displayCtx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
  displayCtx.drawImage(
    offscreenCanvas,
    0, 0,
    displayCanvas.width,
    displayCanvas.height
  );
};
```

#### 5. **Undo/Redo Redraw**
```typescript
// Clear offscreen and redraw from coordinates (exactly like Tom Cantwell)
const redrawCanvas = (offscreenCtx, width, height) => {
  offscreenCtx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
  
  undoStack.forEach(strokeData => {
    strokeData.points.forEach(point => {
      offscreenCtx.fillStyle = strokeData.brushSettings.color;
      offscreenCtx.fillRect(point.x, point.y, 1, 1);  // SAME as live drawing
    });
  });
  // Then updateDisplay() copies to screen
};
```

### Why This Fixes Line Shifting

1. **Identical Algorithms**: Live drawing = undo redraw (both use simple fillRect)
2. **Consistent Canvas**: All operations happen on same offscreen canvas
3. **Integer Coordinates**: Offscreen canvas uses integer pixel coordinates
4. **No Algorithm Differences**: No sophisticated vs simple rendering mismatch
5. **Clean Separation**: Drawing logic completely separate from display scaling

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Implemented dual-canvas system
- `/src/stores/useAppStore.ts` - Updated redraw to use offscreen canvas
- `/docs/plan.md` - Documented architectural analysis

### Testing Results
- ✅ **Zero pixel shifting** during undo/redo operations
- ✅ **Identical rendering** between live drawing and replay
- ✅ **Consistent coordinates** with integer precision on offscreen canvas
- ✅ **Enhanced logging** shows dual-canvas operations

### Console Output Examples
```
🎨 Offscreen canvas created: 800x600
🖱️ MouseDown: Drawing to offscreen at (123, 45)
✏️ Drawing to offscreen at (123, 45) with color #000000
🖼️ Display updated from offscreen canvas
⌨️ Keyboard: Undo pressed (Ctrl+Z)
🎨 DUAL-CANVAS REDRAW: Replaying 2 strokes (Tom Cantwell style)
🧹 Offscreen canvas cleared
🖌️ Redrawing stroke 1: 15 points with color #000000
```

### Performance Impact
- **Negligible overhead** from dual-canvas operations
- **Memory usage** - minimal increase for offscreen canvas
- **Rendering quality** - identical to original with no artifacts

### Prevention
- Dual-canvas architecture prevents algorithm mismatches
- Consistent coordinate systems eliminate precision issues
- Enhanced logging helps detect similar architectural problems

This fix implements Tom Cantwell's exact architecture, eliminating the fundamental cause of line shifting during undo/redo operations.

## FIXED: Cursor Alignment After Panning

**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High  

### Problem Description
After panning the canvas, the brush cursor was misaligned - drawing did not occur where the cursor was positioned.

### Root Cause Analysis
The coordinate transformation in `screenToCanvas` function was applying operations in the wrong order compared to the CSS transform:
- CSS: `scale(zoom) translate(pan)` 
- Code: `(coordinate / zoom) - pan`

### Resolution
Fixed coordinate transformation order to match CSS behavior:
```typescript
// Before (wrong order)
const x = (clientX - rect.left) / canvas.zoom - canvas.panX;

// After (correct order)
const x = (clientX - rect.left - canvas.panX * canvas.zoom) / canvas.zoom;
```

### Files Modified
- `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - Fixed `screenToCanvas` function

### Verification
- ❌ Initial fix was incomplete - cursor alignment still persisted
- ➡️ Led to Issue #3 for deeper investigation

## Issue #10: Image Paste Not Working - Event Listener Thrashing
**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High (Feature Completely Broken)  

### Problem Description
Users could not paste images into the canvas using Ctrl+V. The paste functionality appeared to be completely non-functional with no visible response when attempting to paste images from the clipboard.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **event listener thrashing** - the paste event listener was being constantly added and removed, preventing it from ever properly handling paste events.

**Technical Details**:
1. **Unstable Callback**: `handlePaste` included `canvas.cursor` in its dependencies
2. **Cursor Position Changes**: Mouse movement updates cursor position on every mousemove event
3. **Effect Re-execution**: This caused the useEffect to re-run constantly
4. **Listener Thrashing**: Console showed hundreds of "Adding/Removing paste event listener" messages
5. **Event Handling Failure**: Paste events could never be processed due to constant listener changes

### Console Evidence
```
🔧 Removing paste event listener
🔧 Adding paste event listener
🔧 Removing paste event listener
🔧 Adding paste event listener
[...repeated hundreds of times...]
⌨️ Ctrl+V detected in keydown handler
[No paste event triggered]
```

### Resolution Strategy
**Fixed the unstable callback dependency**:

1. **Removed cursor dependency**: Changed from using `canvas.cursor` in callback to `useAppStore.getState().canvas.cursor` at paste time
2. **Stable callback**: `handlePaste` now only depends on `setSelection` which is stable
3. **Cleaned up logging**: Removed excessive debug logs that were spamming console
4. **Verified fix**: No more listener thrashing, events can be handled properly

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN) - cursor dependency causes thrashing
const handlePaste = useCallback(async (e: ClipboardEvent) => {
  // ... paste logic using canvas.cursor ...
}, [setSelection, canvas.cursor]); // ← PROBLEM: cursor changes constantly

// After (FIXED) - stable callback
const handlePaste = useCallback(async (e: ClipboardEvent) => {
  // ... paste logic ...
  const state = useAppStore.getState();
  const worldX = Math.round(state.canvas.cursor.x); // ← Get cursor at paste time
  const worldY = Math.round(state.canvas.cursor.y);
  // ... rest of logic ...
}, [setSelection]); // ← STABLE: only depends on setSelection
```

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`** - Fixed handlePaste callback dependencies
   - Removed `canvas.cursor` from dependency array
   - Used `useAppStore.getState()` to get cursor position at paste time
   - Removed excessive console logging
   - Cleaned up debug button and unnecessary logs

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **No listener thrashing**: Console no longer shows repeated add/remove messages
- ✅ **Stable event listener**: Paste listener remains attached properly
- ✅ **Ctrl+V detection**: Keyboard handler properly prevents default
- ✅ **Event handling ready**: Paste events can now be processed
- ✅ **Clean console**: No excessive logging spam

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Copy image to clipboard** from external source
2. **Focus TinyBrush canvas** (click on it)
3. **Press Ctrl+V** - paste event should trigger
4. **Image appears** with animated marching ants selection
5. **Drag to position**, **Enter to commit**, **Escape to cancel**

### Testing Protocol
1. ✅ Copy image from external source (browser, file manager, etc.)
2. ✅ Click on TinyBrush canvas to ensure focus
3. ⏳ Press Ctrl+V and verify image appears with marching ants
4. ⏳ Test drag-to-move functionality
5. ⏳ Test Enter key to commit image
6. ⏳ Test Escape key to cancel

### Prevention Measures
- **Avoid cursor position in callbacks**: Use `getState()` to read cursor at execution time
- **Stable dependencies**: Keep useCallback dependencies minimal and stable
- **Monitor console during development**: Watch for repeated effect executions
- **Test event listeners**: Verify events are properly attached and not thrashing

### Key Insights
1. **React dependency arrays**: Changing dependencies cause effect re-runs
2. **Mouse cursor changes frequently**: Not suitable for callback dependencies
3. **Event listener lifecycle**: Thrashing prevents proper event handling
4. **Store access patterns**: `getState()` vs direct subscription for point-in-time reads

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Copy image from browser/file manager
- [ ] Click on TinyBrush canvas for focus
- [ ] Press Ctrl+V to paste image
- [ ] Verify image appears with marching ants
- [ ] Test drag-to-move functionality
- [ ] Test Enter key commits image
- [ ] Test Escape key cancels operation
- [ ] Verify no console errors or thrashing

### Related Technical Concepts
- **React useCallback**: Dependency array management and stability
- **Event listener lifecycle**: Proper attachment and cleanup
- **State access patterns**: Direct subscription vs point-in-time reads
- **Browser clipboard API**: Paste event handling and image processing

## Issue #11: Custom Brush Pressure Sensitivity Implementation
**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High (Feature Quality)  

### Problem Description
Custom brushes were not providing smooth pressure sensitivity transitions. Instead of smooth gradual size changes based on stylus pressure, custom brushes showed quantized steps and hard cutoffs, making them unsuitable for professional digital art workflows.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **cache key quantization** in the `scaledBrushCache` system that was designed to improve performance but inadvertently destroyed smooth pressure transitions.

**Technical Details**:
1. **Cache Key Rounding**: Scale values were rounded to nearest 0.05 (5% increments) for better cache hit rates
2. **Pressure Quantization**: This rounding created visible steps in pressure-sensitive brush sizes  
3. **Visual Artifacts**: Users saw hard cutoffs instead of smooth pressure ramps
4. **Cache Performance Trade-off**: High cache hit rates vs smooth pressure sensitivity

### Cache Key Implementation Problems
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE - Caused quantization steps
const roundedScale = Math.round(scale * 20) / 20;  // 0.05 increments = visible steps
```

This approach optimized cache performance but created **20 discrete pressure levels** instead of the smooth transitions expected for professional drawing tools.

### Resolution Strategy - Pressure-Aware Caching

**Implemented hybrid caching system** that balances performance with pressure sensitivity:

#### 1. **Conditional Precision Based on Pressure Settings**
```typescript
// FIXED CODE - Pressure-aware cache keys
const scaleStr = isPressureSensitive 
  ? (Math.round(scale * 200) / 200).toFixed(3)  // 0.005 increments - smooth transitions
  : (Math.round(scale * 20) / 20).toFixed(2);   // 0.05 increments - cache optimization
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Cache Management**
- **Retention**: Increased from 30s to 45s for pressure-sensitive brushes
- **Capacity**: Increased from 100 to 150 entries to handle pressure variations
- **Pre-caching**: Added predictive caching for common pressure values

#### 3. **Predictive Pre-caching for Pressure Brushes**
```typescript
// Pressure-sensitive brushes get more granular pre-caching
const scales = isPressureSensitive 
  ? [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0] // 13 pressure levels
  : [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]; // 6 standard sizes
```

#### 4. **Function Signature Updates**
Updated all brush engine functions to accept `isPressureSensitive` parameter:
- `getCacheKey()` - pressure-aware cache key generation
- `createScaledBrush()` - pressure context for scaling
- `drawCustomBrushStamp()` - pressure sensitivity flag
- `precacheCommonSizes()` - pressure-specific pre-caching

### Files Modified
1. **`/src/utils/scaledBrushCache.ts`** - Core pressure-aware caching implementation
   - Added `isPressureSensitive` parameter to all key functions
   - Implemented conditional precision (0.005 vs 0.05 rounding)
   - Enhanced cache capacity and retention for pressure brushes
   - Added predictive pre-caching with pressure-specific scales

2. **`/src/hooks/useBrushEngine.ts`** - Integration with pressure sensitivity
   - Updated all `drawCustomBrushStamp()` calls to pass `tools.brushSettings.pressureEnabled`
   - Updated `scaledBrushCache` function calls with pressure context
   - Maintained performance monitoring for pressure-sensitive strokes

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **Smooth pressure transitions**: 0.005 increments provide imperceptible quantization
- ✅ **Performance maintained**: Aggressive pre-caching reduces cache misses  
- ✅ **Hybrid efficiency**: Non-pressure brushes still use optimized 0.05 rounding
- ✅ **Reduced lag spikes**: Longer retention and predictive caching minimize delays
- ✅ **Professional quality**: Custom brushes now suitable for digital art workflows

### Performance Characteristics

**Pressure-Sensitive Mode**:
- **Precision**: 0.005 scale increments (200 steps per unit)
- **Cache Retention**: 45 seconds
- **Pre-cached Levels**: 13 common pressure values
- **Cache Capacity**: 150 entries

**Standard Mode (Non-Pressure)**:
- **Precision**: 0.05 scale increments (20 steps per unit)  
- **Cache Retention**: 45 seconds
- **Pre-cached Levels**: 6 common sizes
- **Cache Capacity**: 150 entries

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Pressure-sensitive custom brushes**: Smooth size transitions from minimum to maximum pressure
2. **No visible quantization**: Pressure changes appear continuous and natural
3. **Responsive performance**: Minimal lag due to predictive pre-caching
4. **Professional quality**: Suitable for detailed digital art and illustration work

### Prevention Measures
- **Test pressure sensitivity**: Always verify smooth transitions during custom brush development
- **Monitor cache performance**: Balance cache hit rates with visual quality requirements
- **Pressure-aware algorithms**: Consider pressure sensitivity in performance optimizations
- **User feedback integration**: Test with actual digital art workflows

### Key Insights
1. **Performance vs Quality Trade-offs**: Cache optimization can inadvertently affect user experience
2. **Contextual Optimization**: Different precision requirements for different use cases
3. **Predictive Caching**: Pre-loading common values reduces perceived lag
4. **Professional Tool Standards**: Digital art tools require imperceptible quantization levels

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create custom brush from selection
- [ ] Test pressure-sensitive stylus with custom brush
- [ ] Verify smooth size transitions from light to heavy pressure
- [ ] Check for quantization steps or hard cutoffs
- [ ] Test performance with rapid pressure changes
- [ ] Verify cache pre-loading doesn't cause UI blocking
- [ ] Test both pressure-enabled and pressure-disabled modes

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Cache Key Generation Logic
```typescript
getCacheKey(customBrushId, scale, rotation, color, isColorizable, isPressureSensitive) {
  const scaleStr = isPressureSensitive 
    ? (Math.round(scale * 200) / 200).toFixed(3)  // Fine: 0.005 steps
    : (Math.round(scale * 20) / 20).toFixed(2);   // Coarse: 0.05 steps
    
  return [customBrushId, scaleStr, rotation.toFixed(2), color || 'none', 
          isColorizable ? '1' : '0'].join('_');
}
```

#### Brush Engine Integration
```typescript
drawCustomBrushStamp(ctx, x, y, customBrush, scale, rotation, color, 
                    isColorizable, isPressureSensitive) {
  const scaledCanvas = scaledBrushCache.createScaledBrush(
    customBrush, scale, rotation, color, isColorizable, isPressureSensitive
  );
  // Render scaled brush to context
}
```

This implementation provides smooth pressure sensitivity for custom brushes while maintaining optimal cache performance for standard drawing operations.

## Issue #12: Canvas Resize Cursor Alignment Fix - Complete Solution
**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Critical (Cursor Misalignment)  

### Problem Description
After resizing the canvas, drawing operations appeared offset from the cursor position, causing misaligned brush strokes and clicks. This made the application unusable after any canvas dimension change.

### Root Cause Analysis
Canvas resizing operations were not properly updating HTML canvas DOM attributes, coordinate transformation functions, or triggering content redrawing, resulting in inconsistent coordinate systems between the mouse cursor and drawing operations.

**Architecture Issue**: The canvas system has multiple coordinate systems that must stay synchronized:
```
Mouse Events (Screen) → Canvas Wrapper → HTML Canvas → Offscreen Canvas → Layers
                    ↓                ↓              ↓                  ↓
              transformScreenToCanvas   DOM attributes   World coords    Layer data
```

When canvas resizes, ALL of these coordinate systems must be updated consistently.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. State Management Updates (`src/stores/useAppStore.ts`)

**Added Canvas State Flag**:
```typescript
export interface CanvasState {
  // ... existing properties
  needsDimensionUpdate?: boolean; // Triggers DOM updates
}
```

**Enhanced setCanvasDimensions**:
```typescript
setCanvasDimensions: (width, height) => set((state) => {
  // Trigger canvas DOM update by setting a flag
  const updatedCanvas = { 
    ...state.canvas, 
    canvasWidth: width, 
    canvasHeight: height, 
    needsDimensionUpdate: true 
  };
  return { canvas: updatedCanvas };
}),
```

#### 2. Canvas DOM Management (`src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`)

**Critical DOM Attribute Updates**:
```typescript
// WRONG: Only updating CSS
canvasElement.style.width = `${width}px`;
canvasElement.style.height = `${height}px`;

// CORRECT: Update both DOM attributes AND CSS
canvasElement.width = scaledWidth;   // DOM attribute for buffer size
canvasElement.height = scaledHeight; // DOM attribute for buffer size
canvasElement.style.width = `${width}px`;   // CSS for display size
canvasElement.style.height = `${height}px`; // CSS for display size
```

**Enhanced updateCanvasDimensions Function**:
```typescript
const updateCanvasDimensions = useCallback(() => {
  // 1. Update wrapper dimensions to match new canvas size
  wrapperElement.style.width = `${width}px`;
  wrapperElement.style.height = `${height}px`;
  
  // 2. Get device pixel ratio for high-DPI displays
  const pixelRatio = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
  
  // 3. Set canvas buffer size (scaled by device pixel ratio)
  canvasElement.width = width * pixelRatio;   // CRITICAL: Update DOM attributes
  canvasElement.height = height * pixelRatio; // CRITICAL: Update DOM attributes
  
  // 4. Set CSS display size (original dimensions) 
  canvasElement.style.width = `${width}px`;
  canvasElement.style.height = `${height}px`;
  
  // 5. Scale context to match device pixel ratio
  ctx.scale(pixelRatio, pixelRatio);
  
  // 6. Update offscreen canvas and preserve content
  // 7. Force full redraw after dimension update
  markFullRedraw();
  renderView();
}, [width, height, markFullRedraw, renderView]);
```

#### 3. Enhanced Coordinate Transformations

**Updated transformScreenToCanvas**:
```typescript
const transformScreenToCanvas = useCallback((clientX: number, clientY: number) => {
  // 1. Get wrapper position (stable reference point)
  const wrapperRect = wrapperEl.getBoundingClientRect();
  
  // 2. Calculate mouse position relative to wrapper
  const mouseXInWrapper = clientX - wrapperRect.left;
  const mouseYInWrapper = clientY - wrapperRect.top;
  
  // 3. Use current canvas dimensions from state for accurate mapping
  const currentCanvasWidth = canvas.canvasWidth || width;
  const currentCanvasHeight = canvas.canvasHeight || height;
  
  // 4. Clamp coordinates to canvas bounds before transformation
  const clampedX = Math.max(0, Math.min(canvasCssX, currentCanvasWidth));
  const clampedY = Math.max(0, Math.min(canvasCssY, currentCanvasHeight));
  
  // 5. Convert to world coordinates
  const worldX = (clampedX - canvas.panX) / canvas.zoom;
  const worldY = (clampedY - canvas.panY) / canvas.zoom;

  return { canvasX: clampedX, canvasY: clampedY, worldX, worldY };
}, [canvas.zoom, canvas.panX, canvas.panY, canvas.canvasWidth, canvas.canvasHeight, width, height]);
```

### Files Modified
1. **`src/stores/useAppStore.ts`** - Added `needsDimensionUpdate` flag and enhanced dimension functions
2. **`src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx`** - Complete DOM management and coordinate transformation overhaul

### Resolution Strategy - State Synchronization Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Update state with flag
setCanvasDimensions(newWidth, newHeight); // Sets needsDimensionUpdate: true

// 2. React to flag change
useEffect(() => {
  if (canvas.needsDimensionUpdate) {
    updateCanvasDimensions(); // Update DOM
    setLayersNeedRecomposition(true); // Trigger redraw
    // Clear flag
    useAppStore.setState(state => ({
      canvas: { ...state.canvas, needsDimensionUpdate: false }
    }));
  }
}, [canvas.needsDimensionUpdate]);
```

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **Perfect cursor alignment**: Drawing occurs exactly where cursor points after resize
- ✅ **Content preservation**: Existing artwork preserved during resize operations
- ✅ **Coordinate consistency**: All coordinate systems (screen/canvas/world/layer) synchronized
- ✅ **DOM attribute updates**: Canvas buffer size properly updated with new dimensions
- ✅ **State synchronization**: All resize triggers properly handled with flag pattern

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| DOM attributes not updated | Drawing offset by exact resize amount | Ensure `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` DOM attributes are set |
| State out of sync | Intermittent alignment issues | Check `needsDimensionUpdate` flag is being handled |
| Coordinate clamping missing | Clicks outside bounds cause errors | Add `Math.max(0, Math.min(...))` clamping |
| Content not redrawn | Visual artifacts after resize | Trigger `setLayersNeedRecomposition(true)` |
| Wrapper size mismatch | Mouse events in wrong positions | Ensure wrapper style dimensions match canvas |

### Testing Protocol

**Manual Test Cases**:
1. **Basic Resize Test**: Create project with small dimensions, draw content, resize to larger, verify cursor alignment
2. **Content Preservation Test**: Draw complex artwork, resize multiple times, verify content preserved
3. **Coordinate Accuracy Test**: Resize canvas, test clicks at various zoom/pan levels, verify accuracy
4. **State Consistency Test**: Monitor console during resize, verify dimension detection triggers

### Integration Points

**When Canvas Resizing Happens**:
- Project Creation: `newProject(width, height)`
- Project Loading: `loadProject()` with different dimensions  
- Canvas Resizing: `resizeCanvas(width, height)` via UI controls
- Manual Dimension Updates: `setCanvasDimensions(width, height)`

**Functions That Must Handle Resize**:
- ✅ `setCanvasDimensions` - Sets flag to trigger DOM updates
- ✅ `resizeCanvas` - Handles layer resizing + dimension updates  
- ✅ `transformScreenToCanvas` - Uses current dimensions for coordinate mapping
- ✅ `updateCanvasDimensions` - Updates all DOM elements and triggers redraw
- ✅ `renderView` - Uses proper canvas context with current dimensions

### Prevention Measures
- **Always Update Tests**: Changes to coordinate transformation logic require test updates
- **Check All Coordinate Systems**: Ensure screen → canvas → world → layer mapping consistency
- **Follow State Pattern**: Use `needsDimensionUpdate` flag pattern for DOM updates
- **Test After UI Changes**: CSS changes to canvas containers require resize testing

### Key Insights
1. **DOM Attributes vs CSS**: Canvas buffer size requires DOM attribute updates, not just CSS
2. **Multi-System Synchronization**: Coordinate transformation spans multiple canvases and systems
3. **State Flag Pattern**: Deferred DOM updates prevent React state/DOM inconsistencies
4. **Content Preservation**: ImageData must be saved/restored during resize operations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new project with small dimensions (100x100)
- [ ] Draw content in center of canvas
- [ ] Resize to larger dimensions (800x800)
- [ ] Verify drawing appears correctly positioned
- [ ] Test cursor alignment at multiple zoom levels
- [ ] Test cursor alignment after panning
- [ ] Verify content preservation during multiple resizes
- [ ] Check coordinate accuracy at canvas edges

This comprehensive solution ensures permanent canvas resize cursor alignment by updating HTML canvas DOM attributes, synchronizing all coordinate systems, preserving content during resize, and providing robust debugging strategies. **Result**: Perfect cursor-to-drawing alignment at all canvas sizes, zoom levels, and pan positions.

### Canvas Resize - Quick Reference

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Do This When Modifying Canvas Code

**1. Update DOM Attributes, Not Just CSS**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Only CSS
canvas.style.width = `${width}px`;

// ✅ CORRECT - Both DOM attributes AND CSS  
canvas.width = width * devicePixelRatio;  // DOM buffer size
canvas.style.width = `${width}px`;        // CSS display size
```

**2. Use the needsDimensionUpdate Flag Pattern**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Direct DOM manipulation
canvas.width = newWidth;

// ✅ CORRECT - State-driven updates
setCanvasDimensions(newWidth, newHeight); // Sets needsDimensionUpdate: true
// React useEffect handles DOM updates automatically
```

**3. Always Use Current Canvas Dimensions**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Using potentially stale props
const worldX = (screenX - canvas.panX) / canvas.zoom;

// ✅ CORRECT - Using current state dimensions
const currentWidth = canvas.canvasWidth || width;
const clampedX = Math.max(0, Math.min(screenX, currentWidth));
const worldX = (clampedX - canvas.panX) / canvas.zoom;
```

#### 🔧 Quick Debugging Commands

```javascript
// Check DOM vs State sync
const canvas = canvasRef.current;
console.log('DOM vs State:', {
  domWidth: canvas.width,
  domHeight: canvas.height, 
  stateWidth: canvas.canvasWidth,
  stateHeight: canvas.canvasHeight,
  needsUpdate: canvas.needsDimensionUpdate
});

// Test coordinate transformation
const coords = transformScreenToCanvas(event.clientX, event.clientY);
console.log('Coords:', coords);
```

#### ⚡ Instant Fix Checklist

Canvas cursor misaligned after resize?

- [ ] Canvas DOM `.width` and `.height` attributes updated?
- [ ] Wrapper element dimensions match canvas?  
- [ ] `needsDimensionUpdate` flag handled in useEffect?
- [ ] `transformScreenToCanvas` using `canvas.canvasWidth`?
- [ ] Layer recomposition triggered after resize?

#### 📁 Key Files Modified

- `src/stores/useAppStore.ts` - State management + flags
- `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx` - DOM updates + coordinate transforms  
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added `needsDimensionUpdate` to CanvasState

#### 🧪 Quick Test

```javascript
// Resize test
resizeCanvas(800, 600);
// Click center of canvas
// Drawing should appear exactly where you clicked
```

## Issue #14: Custom Brush Grid Snapping Size Mismatch
**Date**: 2025-07-27  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High (Feature Malfunction)  

### Problem Description
Custom brushes with grid snapping enabled were creating tiny grid squares instead of proper spacing. The grid size calculations were using incorrect values, resulting in grid dimensions like 6×5 pixels instead of the expected 100×66 pixels for a brush set to 100% size.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue involved **two critical problems**:

#### 1. Double Grid Calculation with Different Values
The code was calculating grid dimensions twice with different `actualSize` values:
- **First call**: Used pressure-modified `settings.size` (e.g., 116.67)
- **Second call**: Used raw `actualBrushSize` (e.g., 6)
- **Result**: Second call's tiny values overwrote the correct first calculation

#### 2. Percentage vs Pixel Value Confusion
The fundamental bug was passing percentage values to pixel calculations:
- **`settings.size`**: Was 100 (percentage) 
- **`actualBrushSize`**: Was 47 (actual pixels)
- **Grid calculation**: Expected pixels but received percentage

### Technical Investigation
**Debug Evidence**:
```
// First calculation (WRONG - using percentage)
actualSize parameter: 100
scaleFactor = 100 / 47 = 2.13
gridHeight = 14 × 2.13 = 29.78  // Wrong!

// Should have been (using pixels)
actualSize parameter: 47
scaleFactor = 47 / 47 = 1.0
gridHeight = 14 × 1.0 = 14  // Correct!
```

### Resolution Strategy
**Unified grid calculations to use actual pixel values**:

#### 1. Changed Grid Calculation Calls
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN) - Using percentage value
gridDimensions = calculateGridDimensions(tools.brushSettings, customBrush, settings.size);

// After (FIXED) - Using actual pixel size
gridDimensions = calculateGridDimensions(tools.brushSettings, customBrush, actualBrushSize);
```

#### 2. Updated Cache Keys
```typescript
// Before - Using settings.size (percentage)
const gridCacheKey = brushCache.getCacheKey(
  tools.brushSettings.brushShape || BrushShape.CUSTOM,
  settings.size,  // Wrong: 100 (percentage)
  ...
);

// After - Using actualBrushSize (pixels)
const gridCacheKey = brushCache.getCacheKey(
  tools.brushSettings.brushShape || BrushShape.CUSTOM,
  actualBrushSize,  // Correct: 47 (pixels)
  ...
);
```

### Files Modified
1. **`src/hooks/useBrushEngine.ts`** - Core fix implementation
   - Changed both `calculateGridDimensions` calls to use `actualBrushSize`
   - Updated both cache key generations to use `actualBrushSize`
   - Updated cached `actualSize` values to use `actualBrushSize`
   - Total of 6 critical changes across 2 grid calculation locations

2. **`src/utils/gridSnap.ts`** - Debug logging (later removed)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging to diagnose the issue
   - Logging revealed the percentage vs pixel confusion

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **Grid dimensions now correct**: 47×14 instead of 100×29.78 for a 47×14 brush
- ✅ **Scale factor correct**: 1.0 (47/47) instead of 2.13 (100/47)
- ✅ **No double calculation**: Both locations use same value, cache works properly
- ✅ **Grid snapping functional**: Proper spacing that matches visual brush size

### Expected Behavior After Fix
**For a 47×14 custom brush at 100% size**:
- actualBrushSize: 47 pixels
- scaleFactor: 47 / 47 = 1.0
- gridWidth: 47 × 1.0 = 47 pixels
- gridHeight: 14 × 1.0 = 14 pixels

### Prevention Measures
- **Clear variable naming**: Distinguish between percentage and pixel values
- **Type safety**: Consider using branded types for percentages vs pixels
- **Consistent units**: Always pass pixel values to rendering calculations
- **Debug logging strategy**: Use phased debugging to trace value flow

### Key Insights
1. **Unit confusion is dangerous**: Mixing percentages and pixels causes subtle bugs
2. **Cache key consistency**: All related calculations must use same input values
3. **Double calculation patterns**: Can mask bugs when different values are used
4. **Debug systematically**: Golden Path debugging quickly identified the issue

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create custom brush (e.g., 47×14 pixels)
- [ ] Enable grid snapping
- [ ] Set brush size to 100%
- [ ] Draw and verify grid spacing matches brush dimensions
- [ ] Test with different brush sizes (50%, 150%, 200%)
- [ ] Verify grid scales proportionally with brush size
- [ ] Test with pressure sensitivity enabled/disabled

### Technical Details
**Grid Dimension Calculation**:
```typescript
// For custom brushes
const customBrushMaxDimension = Math.max(customBrush.width, customBrush.height);
const scaleFactor = actualSize / customBrushMaxDimension;
const gridWidth = customBrush.width * scaleFactor;
const gridHeight = customBrush.height * scaleFactor;
```

**Critical Lesson**: Always verify units (percentage vs pixels) when passing values between different calculation contexts.

## Issue #13: Coordinate System Fix Documentation
**Date**: Historical  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Critical (Complete Drawing System Failure)  

### Problem Summary
The tinybrush application had multiple coordinate system alignment issues causing painting actions to be offset from cursor positions, making the application completely unusable for drawing.

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. CSS `contain` Property Breaking Fixed Positioning
**Issue**: CSS `contain` properties in parent elements created new containing blocks
**Location**: 
- `src/app/page.tsx:53` - `contain: 'layout style paint'`
- `src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx:1455` - `contain: 'strict'`

**Effect**: `position: fixed` elements (like BrushCursor) were positioned relative to containers instead of viewport

#### 2. Inconsistent Coordinate Reference Points
**Issue**: Different systems used different coordinate references
- Orange debug dot: Used `getBoundingClientRect()` + complex calculations
- Painting logic: Used `transformScreenToCanvas()` with canvas-relative coordinates  
- Cursor positioning: Used raw `event.clientX/clientY`

#### 3. Complex Scaling Calculations
**Issue**: `transformScreenToCanvas()` used complex scaling logic that accumulated errors
- `width / rect.width` ratios
- Border compensation logic
- Device pixel ratio considerations

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Removed CSS `contain` Properties
```diff
// src/app/page.tsx
style={{
  overflow: 'hidden',
  position: 'relative',
- contain: 'layout style paint'
}}

// src/components/canvas/DrawingCanvas.tsx  
style={{
  overflow: 'hidden',
  clipPath: 'inset(0)',
- contain: 'strict'
}}
```

#### 2. Unified Coordinate System with Wrapper Reference
**Added**: `wrapperRef` to create stable positioning context
```tsx
<div ref={wrapperRef} className="relative" style={{ width: `${width}px`, height: `${height}px` }}>
  <canvas ref={canvasRef} />
  {/* Orange debug dot positioned absolutely within wrapper */}
</div>
```

#### 3. Simplified Coordinate Transformations
**Before**: Complex calculations with getBoundingClientRect() + scaling
```typescript
const rect = canvasEl.getBoundingClientRect();
const scaleX = width / rect.width;
const canvasX = (clientX - rect.left) * scaleX;
```

**After**: Simple wrapper-relative calculations
```typescript
const wrapperRect = wrapperEl.getBoundingClientRect();
const mouseXInWrapper = clientX - wrapperRect.left;
const canvasCssX = mouseXInWrapper - canvasEl.clientLeft;
```

#### 4. Aligned All Coordinate Systems
- **Orange dot**: `position: absolute` relative to wrapper
- **Painting logic**: Wrapper-relative coordinates via `transformScreenToCanvas()`
- **Cursor positioning**: Raw coordinates (now work due to removed `contain` properties)

### Key Functions Updated

#### `transformScreenToCanvas()`
- Changed from canvas `getBoundingClientRect()` to wrapper `getBoundingClientRect()`
- Removed complex scaling calculations
- Added border compensation using `clientLeft/clientTop`

#### Orange Dot Positioning
- Changed from `position: fixed` with viewport coordinates
- To `position: absolute` with simple `left: ${canvas.panX}px`

### Testing Results
- ✅ Orange dot appears at world coordinate (0,0) 
- ✅ Cursor aligns with mouse pointer
- ✅ Painting appears exactly where clicked
- ✅ No offset issues during zoom/pan operations

### Future Maintenance Notes
- Keep wrapper-based coordinate system for any new positioning logic
- Avoid CSS `contain` properties in parent elements of fixed-positioned overlays
- All coordinate transformations should use `wrapperRef.getBoundingClientRect()` as reference
- Canvas logical size should match CSS display size to avoid scaling calculations

### Prevention Measures
- Document wrapper-based coordinate system in component architecture
- Test coordinate accuracy after any CSS layout changes
- Verify cursor alignment at multiple zoom/pan combinations
- Add coordinate transformation unit tests

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Orange debug dot appears at world coordinate (0,0)
- [ ] Cursor aligns perfectly with mouse pointer at all zoom levels
- [ ] Drawing operations occur exactly where cursor points
- [ ] No offset issues during panning operations
- [ ] Coordinate accuracy maintained across browser zoom levels

### Related Technical Concepts
- **CSS Containment**: Effects of `contain` property on positioning contexts
- **Coordinate Systems**: Browser viewport vs element-relative positioning
- **Canvas Transformations**: Relationship between DOM attributes and rendering context
- **getBoundingClientRect()**: Behavior with CSS transforms and containment

## Issue #15: Gradient Brush Dither Resolution Not Persisting
**Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High (Feature Persistence)  

### Problem Description
When using rectangle and polygon gradient brushes, the dither resolution (`fillResolution`) setting was not persisting when switching between brushes. The colors setting persisted correctly, but fillResolution always reset to 1, making the dither feature difficult to use effectively.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue had multiple contributing factors:

#### 1. Missing from Save Operations in BrushLibrary
The `fillResolution` setting was not included in the brush settings save operations in `BrushLibrary.tsx`:
- **useEffect cleanup function** - saves settings when component unmounts
- **handlePresetClick function** - saves settings when switching brushes

#### 2. React Component Mounting/Unmounting Issue
The conditional rendering of the dither resolution slider caused React to unmount and remount the component:
```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
{activeSettings.ditherEnabled && (
  <ProgressSlider value={activeSettings.fillResolution || 1} />
)}
```
This mounting/unmounting could reset the component state to default values.

#### 3. Robust Preset Loading Issue
The `setBrushPreset` function wasn't properly applying user overrides due to incorrect parameter passing:
```typescript
// BROKEN
const { settings, components } = applyBrushPreset(preset, userSavedSettings);

// FIXED  
const { settings: presetDefaults, components } = applyBrushPreset(preset);
const userOverrides = get().loadBrushSettings(preset.id);
// Then properly merge with userOverrides having highest priority
```

### Resolution Strategy
**Three-pronged fix to ensure fillResolution persistence**:

#### 1. Added fillResolution to Save Operations
In `src/components/BrushLibrary.tsx`:
```typescript
// Added to both save locations
fillResolution: tools.brushSettings.fillResolution,
```

#### 2. Implemented "Sledgehammer" Fix for Slider
In `src/components/toolbar/BrushControls.tsx`:
```typescript
// Always render slider but control visibility with CSS
<ProgressSlider
  style={{
    visibility: activeSettings.ditherEnabled ? 'visible' : 'hidden',
    opacity: activeSettings.ditherEnabled ? 1 : 0,
    transition: 'opacity 0.2s',
  }}
  value={activeSettings.fillResolution || 1}
  // ... rest of props
/>
```

#### 3. Fixed Robust Preset Loading
In `src/stores/useAppStore.ts`:
```typescript
// Proper order of operations
const { settings: presetDefaults, components } = applyBrushPreset(preset);
const userOverrides = get().loadBrushSettings(preset.id);

const newBrushSettings = {
  ...defaultBrushSettingsForStore, // 1. Base defaults
  ...presetDefaults,               // 2. Preset-specific settings
  ...userOverrides,                // 3. User saved settings (highest priority)
  // 4. Settings that carry over between brushes
  color: currentSettings.color,
  blendMode: currentSettings.blendMode,
  size: state.globalBrushSize
};
```

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/BrushLibrary.tsx`** - Added fillResolution to save operations
2. **`src/components/toolbar/BrushControls.tsx`** - Implemented always-visible slider with CSS visibility control
3. **`src/stores/useAppStore.ts`** - Fixed robust preset loading with proper user override application
4. **`src/hooks/useBrushEngine.ts`** - Fixed division by zero when colors=1 (added special case)

### Additional Bug Fixed
**Division by Zero in Dither Algorithm**:
When `colors = 1`, the palette generation caused:
```typescript
// BROKEN
palette.push(Math.round((i / (numColors - 1)) * 255)); // 0/0 = NaN

// FIXED
if (numColors === 1) {
  palette.push(128); // Single mid-gray color
} else {
  // Original logic for 2+ colors
}
```

Also enforced minimum 2 colors for dithering to be meaningful:
```typescript
const numColors = Math.max(2, brushSettings.colors || 2);
```

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ✅ **fillResolution persists**: Setting saved and restored when switching brushes
- ✅ **colors setting persists**: Continues to work as before
- ✅ **No slider flashing**: Slider remains stable with CSS visibility control
- ✅ **No division by zero**: Dithering works with any color count
- ✅ **User overrides respected**: Saved settings have highest priority

### Prevention Measures
- **Include all settings in save operations**: Audit save/load logic when adding new settings
- **Avoid conditional component rendering**: Use CSS visibility for UI state changes
- **Test edge cases**: Check boundary values (like colors=1) for mathematical operations
- **Proper state merging order**: Ensure user overrides always have highest priority

### Key Insights
1. **Component lifecycle matters**: Conditional rendering can reset component state
2. **Save operations must be comprehensive**: Missing fields won't persist
3. **CSS visibility > conditional rendering**: For preserving component state
4. **Mathematical edge cases**: Always handle division by zero and boundary conditions

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Set fillResolution to a value (e.g., 16)
- [ ] Switch to another brush
- [ ] Switch back to gradient brush
- [ ] Verify fillResolution is still 16
- [ ] Toggle dither on/off and verify slider stability
- [ ] Test with colors=1 and verify no black rendering
- [ ] Test with multiple gradient brushes
