## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- **Target**: Smooth drawing performance
- **Strategy**: Native Canvas API only (no P5.js, Fabric.js, or other libraries), efficient rendering, smart caching
- **Monitoring**: Implement performance tracking from day one

### Architecture Principles
- **Simplicity**: No components over 200 lines
- **Focus**: Single responsibility per component
- **Clean State**: Clear Zustand store boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **UI Reference**: Frontend template available in `/assets` folder for styling reference

### Risk Mitigation
- **Start Simple**: Basic functionality before complex features
- **Prove Performance**: Validate smooth performance early and often
- **Incremental Complexity**: Add sophistication gradually
- **Test Early**: Performance monitoring throughout development

# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Right Column Padding Not Visible

## Problem
No visible padding in right column despite adding `p-4` to container.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Parent container has `p-4` padding (16px all sides)  
- BrushLibrary component has `flex-1` property
- `flex-1` makes component expand to fill ALL available space, including padding area
- Component backgrounds extend to edges, hiding padding completely

## Current Problematic Structure
```tsx
<div className="p-4">          // 16px padding
  <BrushLibrary flex-1 />      // Expands to fill all space INCLUDING padding
  <ControlsPanel />
</div>
```

## Solution Strategy
Replace problematic flex expansion with gap-based layout:

1. Remove conflicting `flex-1` from BrushLibrary
2. Use `gap-4` for component spacing  
3. Maintain `p-4` for outer edge padding
4. Ensure components don't expand beyond their content needs

## Implementation Steps
1. Remove `flex-1` from BrushLibrary component
2. Add proper height constraints to prevent expansion
3. Test visual spacing verification
4. Verify layout integrity

## Expected Result
- 16px padding visible on all edges
- 16px spacing between components
- No background color overlap hiding padding
- Clean, predictable layout behavior

# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Image Paste Not Working

## Problem
User reports that image paste functionality is not working. Images cannot be pasted into the canvas using Ctrl+V.

## Diagnostic Plan

### Step 1: Add Comprehensive Logging
Added logging at every critical point:
- Paste event listener registration
- Clipboard event handling
- Image data processing
- Selection state updates
- Rendering pipeline

### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis
Potential issues to investigate:
1. **Event Listener Not Registered**: Check if paste event listener is properly attached
2. **Browser Security**: Clipboard API may be blocked or restricted
3. **Image Format Issues**: Clipboard data might not contain valid image data
4. **State Update Failure**: Selection state might not be updating correctly
5. **Rendering Issue**: Selection might be set but not rendered
6. **Focus Issue**: Canvas might not have focus to receive paste events

### Step 3: Testing Protocol
1. Open browser console
2. Copy an image to clipboard
3. Focus on TinyBrush canvas
4. Press Ctrl+V
5. Check console logs for:
   - "🔧 Adding paste event listener" (on load)
   - "🎯 Paste event triggered" (on Ctrl+V)
   - "📋 Clipboard items" (clipboard contents)
   - "🖼️ Found image item" (image detection)
   - "✅ Selection set successfully" (state update)
   - "🎨 Drawing selection overlay" (rendering)

### Step 4: Potential Fixes
Based on log results:
- If no paste event: Check focus handling
- If no image in clipboard: Verify clipboard content
- If state not updating: Debug state management
- If not rendering: Fix render pipeline

## Implementation Status
✅ Comprehensive logging added to all paste-related code
✅ Root cause identified: Event listener thrashing
✅ Fix implemented: Stable handlePaste callback

## Root Cause Analysis (Completed)
The issue was caused by **event listener thrashing**:
1. `handlePaste` callback included `canvas.cursor` in dependencies
2. Cursor position changes on every mouse move
3. This caused the effect to re-run constantly, adding/removing paste listener
4. Console showed hundreds of "Adding/Removing paste event listener" messages
5. The paste event could never be properly handled due to constant listener changes

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed cursor dependency**: Use `useAppStore.getState()` to get cursor position at paste time
2. **Cleaned up logging**: Removed excessive debug logs causing console spam
3. **Stable callback**: `handlePaste` now only depends on `setSelection` which is stable
4. **Verified fix**: No more listener thrashing, paste events can now be handled properly

## Testing Status
✅ **RESOLVED AND WORKING**

**User Confirmation**: "works" - User confirmed paste functionality is working correctly

**Final Status**: Image paste feature is fully functional with all planned features:
- ✅ Clipboard paste detection (Ctrl+V)
- ✅ Image conversion to ImageData 
- ✅ Marching ants selection animation
- ✅ Drag-to-move functionality
- ✅ Enter key to commit selection
- ✅ Escape key to cancel selection
- ✅ Modern browser compatibility with API fallbacks

**Root Cause Fixed**: Event listener thrashing resolved by using stable callback dependencies

# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Custom Brush Not Visible After Selection

## Problem
User reports: "i cant see the custom brush or test it after selecting it"

## Analysis
The custom brush workflow has these steps:
1. User selects area with custom-brush tool ✅ (works)
2. Selection area shows marching ants ✅ (works) 
3. Custom brush is created and stored ✅ (works)
4. Brush tool becomes active for testing ❌ (fails - brush not visible)

## Root Cause Investigation

### Architecture Review
The custom brush creation flow:
1. `DrawingCanvas.tsx` - handles selection and calls `createFromSelection()`
2. `useCustomBrush.ts` - creates brush preset with PATTERN_RENDERER component
3. Calls `setBrushPreset()` to apply as active brush
4. `useBrushEngine.ts` - should process PATTERN_RENDERER and render pattern

### Potential Issues Identified
1. **Pattern Component Processing**: PATTERN_RENDERER might not be processed correctly
2. **Component Priority Conflicts**: Components might execute in wrong order
3. **Pattern Data Loss**: ImageData might not be preserved through the pipeline
4. **Fallback Shape Missing**: No SHAPE_RENDERER as fallback if pattern fails

## Debugging Strategy
Added comprehensive logging throughout pipeline:
- `useCustomBrush.ts` - logs brush creation and preset application
- `useBrushEngine.ts` - logs component processing and pattern rendering
- Pattern rendering in `drawShape()` function

## Fixes Applied
1. **Added Shape Fallback**: Added SHAPE_RENDERER component as fallback
2. **Fixed Component Priorities**: 
   - Size: 10
   - Opacity: 20  
   - Anti-aliasing: 30
   - Shape: 35
   - Pattern: 50 (highest to override shape)
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added debug output throughout the pipeline

## Expected Log Flow
```
🎨 CUSTOM_BRUSH: Created custom brush: {id, name, patternSize}
🎨 CUSTOM_BRUSH: Created brush preset: {componentCount, components}
🎨 CUSTOM_BRUSH: Applying brush preset as active brush
🏪 STORE: setBrushPreset called with: [preset info]
⚙️ ENGINE: executeComponents called with [X] components
⚙️ ENGINE: Processing component: PATTERN_RENDERER
🎨 ENGINE: PATTERN_RENDERER component processed: {patternSize, centerAlignment}
🖌️ RENDER_STROKE: Rendering stroke with pattern: [dimensions]
🎨 DRAW_SHAPE: Drawing custom pattern [dimensions] at [x,y]
```

If any step is missing, that's where the issue lies.
